<p>Gandalf is a fictional character and one of the protagonists in J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He is a wizard, member of the Istari order, as well as leader of the Fellowship of the Ring and the army of the West. In The Lord of the Rings, he is initially known as Gandalf the Grey, but returns from death as Gandalf the White.</p>

<!-- Thranduil -->
  <div class="float">
<img src="images/thranduil.jpg" alt="Thranduil" style="width:148px;height:148px;margin-right:10px;">
  
<p>Thranduil is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is a supporting character in The Hobbit, where he is referred to as the Elvenking, and he figures briefly in The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales. Tolkien describes Thranduil as having a crown made of red leaves and berries in the autumn, and wearing a similar crown of flowers in the spring. Like most of the Sindar, he would have been beardless, tall, and grey-eyed. The name "Thranduil" means "vigorous spring" in Sindarin.</p>
</div>
<!-- Legolas --> 
  <div class="float">
<img src="images/legolas.jpg" alt="Legolas" style="width:148px;height:148px;margin-right:10px;">
  
<p>Legolas was the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood, who appears as "the Elvenking" in The Hobbit. Legolas is a Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm and one of nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Thranduil ruled over the Silvan Elves or "Wood-elves" of Mirkwood. Although he lived among the Silvan Elves, Legolas was not one himself. His father Thranduil had originally come from Lindon; he and his son were actually Sindar, or "Grey Elves", called in the singular Sinda; "Sindarin" was their language.</p>
</div>
<!-- Frodo --> 
  <div class="float">
<img src="images/frodo.jpg" alt="Frodo" style="width:148px;height:148px;margin-right:10px;">
  
<p>Frodo Baggins is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, and the main protagonist of The Lord of the Rings. Frodo is a hobbit of the Shire who inherits the One Ring from his cousin (referred to as his uncle) Bilbo Baggins and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom. He is also mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.</p>
</div>
<!-- Gollum --> 
  <div class="float">
<img src="images/gollum.jpg" alt="Gollum" style="width:148px;height:148px;margin-right:10px;">
  
<p>Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields. Originally known as Sméagol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and later named Gollum after his habit of making "a horrible swallowing noise in his throat". <strong>Gollum is my most favorite character from LOTR!!!</strong></p>
